# How to Work With Brian: A Guide for Security Vendors

## Start Here: Understanding What I Actually Need

I'm the CISO at Machinify, a healthcare payment integrity company managing the complex security landscape of a recently merged organization spanning five entities with nearly 3,000 employees. We serve major healthcare payers and maintain HITRUST r2 and SOC 2 certifications while handling protected health information.

**My current reality:** Post-merger integration, infrastructure consolidation across multiple entities, HITRUST audits, customer compliance requirements, and AI governance in healthcare payment integrity.

## Understanding My Decision-Making Style

I'm a pragmatic skeptic with strong technical gatekeeper tendencies. I've seen enough vendor pitches to spot BS instantly. I make decisions based on technical merit and honest assessment of fit - not relationships, not ROI theater, not sales charm. I respect competence and directness. I'll move fast when presented with clear technical evidence, but I'll shut down anything that feels like manipulation or time-wasting. I know what I need, I've done my homework, and I want vendors to prove they can deliver - or admit they can't.

## What Works (Do This)

### Email First, Always
- **Send a concise email** with a clear subject line indicating the specific problem you solve
- Keep it under 150 words - I value directness
- Reference specific challenges relevant to healthcare payment integrity or post-merger security consolidation
- Include pricing transparency or at least a range
- One follow-up email is acceptable after 1-2 weeks; more than that and you're done
- **Don't use a pre-built sales template** - write something specific to my situation
- **Don't use tracking pixels** - I know when you're tracking opens and clicks, and it's creepy

### Show You've Done Your Homework
- Understand that we're integrating multiple compliance frameworks (HITRUST, SOC 2, HIPAA)
- Recognize we serve healthcare payers with stringent security requirements
- Know that we're managing complex vendor and subcontractor relationships across multiple geographies
- Reference actual healthcare compliance challenges, not generic enterprise security talking points

### Lead With Value, Not Features
Problems I'm actively solving that might interest me:
- **Policy and procedure harmonization** across merged entities
- **Audit consolidation** tools and frameworks
- **AI governance** specific to healthcare and payment integrity
- **Vendor risk management** at scale
- **Customer compliance reporting** automation
- **Security tool consolidation** during infrastructure integration

### Be Specific About Implementation
- Timeline expectations for deployment
- Integration requirements with existing security infrastructure
- Resource requirements from my team (we're 14-16 people managing a complex environment)
- Ongoing maintenance burden

### Be Direct With Me
- I value straightforward communication
- If we establish a working relationship and you need help with forecasting, just ask - I'll give you an honest percentage likelihood
- Don't dance around questions or play games
- Clear "yes," "no," or "maybe with conditions" answers work better than vague corporate speak

### If We Get to a Meeting: Get Technical Immediately
**DO:**
- Show me architecture diagrams, integrations, APIs, data flows from the start
- Live product demo with real data - let me drive it and explore
- Bring someone who can answer hard technical questions in real-time (not "I'll follow up on that")
- Be upfront about constraints, limitations, and tradeoffs
- Talk peer-to-peer - assume I have technical competence
- Be direct about fit - admit what you can't do
- Provide concrete evidence: similar customer implementations, documentation, references
- Keep it to 30 minutes max, front-load critical info, leave room for my questions
- Start where my knowledge ends, not at zero
- Lead with specific relevance to my actual environment and requirements

**DON'T:**
- Feature dumps without context for my specific problems
- "Discovery questions" about pain points I already know I have
- Waste time on irrelevant capabilities
- Arrive without understanding my business and technical environment
- Give vague answers on pricing, timelines, or implementation resources
- Oversell without proof or documentation
- Long PowerPoint presentations
- ROI calculators with made-up numbers
- Explain basic security concepts I already understand

**Bottom line:** Skip the script, get technical fast, be honest about gaps, respect that I've done my homework.

## What Doesn't Work (Don't Do This)

### Phone Calls
- ❌ Cold calls to my office
- ❌ LinkedIn InMail pretending we have a connection
- ❌ Calls after business hours
- ❌ "Just checking in" calls
- ❌ Automated dialers and robo-calls
- ❌ Calling from fake local phone numbers to trick me into answering

**I don't answer unsolicited calls. Period. Spoofing local numbers is deceptive and guarantees I'll never work with you.**

### Calendar and Meeting Tactics
- ❌ Sending calendar invites before we've agreed to meet
- ❌ "Holding time" on my calendar without permission
- ❌ Adding me to your CRM meeting workflow automations

**Don't put meetings on my calendar until I've explicitly agreed. It's presumptuous and annoying.**

### Going Around Me
- ❌ Reaching out to my team members when you can't get hold of me
- ❌ Contacting my direct reports to "get an introduction"
- ❌ Multi-threading to other executives when I don't respond

**I'm the one with purchasing authority. If you can't get hold of me, it means I'm not interested or I'm busy. Going around me to my team is a guaranteed way to end the conversation permanently.**

### Gifts and Swag
- ❌ Sending gift baskets, branded items, or promotional merchandise
- ❌ "Thank you" gifts before we've even talked
- ❌ Holiday gifts to "stay top of mind"
- ❌ Conference swag with follow-up expectations

**I won't accept vendor gifts. They go to Goodwill or to staff members who don't make purchasing decisions. You're wasting your marketing budget.**

### Conference and Entertainment Invitations
- ❌ "Meet us at RSA" invitations
- ❌ "Let us take you to dinner" offers
- ❌ Steak dinner meetings
- ❌ Event hospitality suite invitations
- ❌ Sports tickets or entertainment packages

**I'm not attending RSA. I'm not interested in dinners. Don't offer.**

### Fake Rapport Building
- ❌ "Go Hoosiers!" references to Indiana University
- ❌ Comments about IU basketball or football
- ❌ Trying to connect over sports achievements
- ❌ Personal small talk before establishing business relevance

**Don't pretend we're buddies because you looked at my LinkedIn profile. Get to the business value.**

### Staff Augmentation Pitches
- ❌ "We can provide security engineers..."
- ❌ "Offshore development teams available..."
- ❌ "Augment your team with our experts..."

**I don't purchase staff augmentation services.**

### VAR Displacement Attempts
- ❌ "We can be your new value added reseller..."
- ❌ "Let us introduce you to our preferred VAR partners..."
- ❌ Criticizing my existing VAR relationship

**I have a VAR I've worked with for 25 years. We have excellent rapport and trust. I'm not switching. If your product requires a VAR, work through mine.**

### Generic Sales Tactics
- ❌ FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) about breaches
- ❌ "Everyone in healthcare is doing this..."
- ❌ Scheduling a demo before understanding our needs
- ❌ Multi-email sequences with varying creative approaches
- ❌ "I noticed you're hiring..." observations
- ❌ Name-dropping other customers without context
- ❌ Asking me to do your research ("What's your biggest security challenge?")

### Poor Research Signals
- Pitching solutions we clearly already have
- Ignoring that we're a merged organization with integration challenges
- Generic enterprise security pitches that don't address healthcare compliance
- Not understanding HITRUST, HIPAA, or healthcare payer requirements

## Decision-Making Context

### Budget Reality
- Annual planning cycle drives major purchases
- Mid-year procurement requires strong ROI justification
- Post-merger means scrutiny on redundant tools and consolidation opportunities

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Compliance alignment:** Does it support HITRUST, SOC 2, HIPAA requirements?
2. **Integration complexity:** Can it work across our four legacy infrastructures?
3. **Customer visibility:** Will our healthcare payer customers value this?
4. **Team bandwidth:** Can we implement without overwhelming my 14-16 person team?
5. **Total cost of ownership:** Not just licensing, but implementation and maintenance

### Who Influences Decisions
- My security team leaders (we have new management layers being established)
- Compliance and audit teams
- Customer success (for customer-facing compliance requirements)
- Engineering and infrastructure teams during consolidation
- Executive leadership for strategic investments

## Prove You Read This: A Simple Challenge

If you've actually read this page (rather than having an AI summarize it for you), include this in your email:

**I know two other people named Brian Quick in the Indianapolis area. Make an intelligent guess about who they are and why I would know them.**

This requires actual research about me as a person and thoughtful reasoning about my professional and personal context. Generic AI-generated guesses won't cut it. No answer = you dont read instructions or you think your time is more valuable than my time.
## Final Thoughts

I respect vendors who respect my time. If your solution genuinely addresses healthcare payment integrity security challenges during organizational transformation, and you can communicate that concisely via email, I'll read it.

If you're blasting generic enterprise security pitches via phone calls and aggressive email sequences, you're wasting both our time.
